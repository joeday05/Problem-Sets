# TEST SUITE: General Testing Environment
#--------------------
# Stubs (simulated code required by unit being tested)









#--------------------
# Drivers (pre-existing environment needed to test code unit)
#     helper functions, global variables, etc.







##--------------------
# Test Code Unit (function being tested)
# Include exceptions to check for bad data inputs.  
#     try: <code>  except <ErrorType>:
# Include assertions to validate that inputs and outputs are in 
#     expected range / type.  assert <statement>, 'output statement'










#--------------------
# FUNCTION CALLS:

# BLACK-BOX Tests: normal and boundary inputs
# GLASS-BOX Path-Complete Tests: branch combinations; 
#   loop entrance/exit conditions; recursion depth;
#   "none, one, more" heurstic; assertions and exceptions)

# Normal Test Inputs



# Boundary Case Inputs
